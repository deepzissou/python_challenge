# python_challenge

This repository contains the python challenge files PyBank and PyPoll. PyPoll was perhaps the most frustrating assignment yet but still rewarding.
I spent a majority of the day on Geeks for Geeks website as well as the w3schools.com. I did cite most of the new functions and methods I learned from Geeks for Geeks in my code.
I hope that whomever is reading this will find these refences helpful.
The methods and functions include: 

"Import collections" https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html

"Import Counter" https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-collections-module/

"Format Method" https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-string-format-method/ as well as https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_format.asp

"Most Common" function https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/counters-in-python-set-2-accessing-counters/ & https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html

"Sorted" Function https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_sorted.asp , https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html , and https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorted-function-python/

PyBank was pretty straight forward and similar to exercises I had done in class

Dictreader came in handy https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html
